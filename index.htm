		<h1>Larry E. McCalla, Ph.D.</h1><p>In December 2019 I earned my Ph.D. in Learning, Design, and Technology with a focus on creativity from the University of Georgia. My dissertation is titled <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/2356062287/previewPDF" class="card-link" target="_blank"><em>Activity, creativity, and design: Modeling and assessing student development in a project-based course</em> (McCalla, 2019).</a> My experience includes designing, implementing, and researching interventions facilitating the expansion of creative design ability. I also have expertise in instructional design and the requisite technologies.</p>
