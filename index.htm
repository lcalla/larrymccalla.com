			<p class="card-text">The systems oriented analytical framework of activity theory was used to explore student development within a project-based course in order to gain a firmer understanding of the contextual factors shaping students’ creative design ability. Learner autonomy, prototyping, psychological safety, tolerance of ambiguity, and community were found to be major contextual factors that shaped students’ creative design ability. Methods, findings, and implications will be shared, and attendees will learn how to broadly define activity systems. <a href="https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/aect/aect20/" class="card-link" target="_blank">AECT 2020 Virtual International Convention - Towards Culturally-Situated Learning Design and Research</a>.</p>

			<h4 class="card-title">Growing a Community of Creative Designers: Collaborating and Expanding Creative Design Ability - AERA Annual Meeting San Francisco, CA, 2020, Apr 17 - 21</h4>
			<p class="card-text">A mixed-method design informed by activity theory was used to explore student activity and experience within a 15-week undergraduate project-based learning course design in order to gain a firmer understanding of how changes in creative design ability occurred as students designed and delivered projects to solve everyday problems. Learner autonomy, prototyping, psychological comfort, tolerance of ambiguity, and community were found to be the main contextual factors that shaped students’ creative design ability. Based on the findings, a model for growing a community of creative designers was proposed and future research questions were formulated. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/whvdfjn" class="card-link" target="_blank">Moscone Center North Roundtable Session 11</a>.</p>
