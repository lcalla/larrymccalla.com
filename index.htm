<p><em>CHEP, Virginia Tech, 2020</em></p>
			<p>A mixed methods research design was used to explore how the creative design ability of undergraduate student designers developed over the course of a 15-week semester. Surveys, design journal entries, and interviews were used to gather data from the 25 student participants as they identified, designed, and delivered the individual projects that focused their work in the course. Several contextual factors characterized the development of students’ design creativity, and the most prominent were (a) tool exploration, (b) prototyping, (d) community, (d) motivation, and (e) creative agency. Research methodology, findings, and recommendations for future course design and research will be presented.</p>
			
			<p>A mixed methods research design was used to explore how the creative design ability of undergraduate student designers was shaped over the course of a 15-week semester. An extensive review of the creativity and design literature generated a coding scheme that was integrated into an activity system analysis (Engeström, 2014; Jonassen, 2002) of the project-based learning course in this study. Surveys, design journal entries, and interviews gathered data from the 25 student participants as they conducted course work. A pre/post survey (Blizzard et al., 2015) was used to measure changes in participants’ design thinking traits during the semester.</p>
			<p>This research identified five prominent contextual factors that characterized the development of students’ design creativity, which were the following: (a) tool exploration, (b) prototyping, (d) community, (d) motivation, and (e) creative agency. These factors were reciprocal with each other as they expanded, and a sequential timing was found in the establishment of participant motivation and the growth of the course community.</p>
			<p>Journal and interview data suggested granting participants a high degree of autonomy in their course work facilitated their motivation and engagement. Without strong motivation, it is doubtful participants would have engaged the varied design ambiguities of project work as extensively and persistently as they did. It appeared that establishing motivation early in the course was a key to the other gains they experienced as a result of their sustained efforts.</p>
			<p>Once participants settled on project topics, the remaining four factors emerged as a cluster of actions and affect. Tool exploration involved participants identifying design tools and making choices about which ones to use and how to use them. This action was closely bound with prototyping action, in which participants made their abstract design ideas concrete to share them with peers and the course instructor. The presenting and sharing actions involved with tool exploration and prototyping were regular in-class occurrences and facilitated growth of the course community, which emerged as one of the most influential factors that shaped participants’ design creativity. The course community emerged as a design tool that participants used to iterate and improve their design ideas. In this way, participants’ design methodologies expanded from individual to collective orientations as a result of their course experience.</p>
			<p>Creative agency (Karwowski & Beghetto, 2018; Royalty, Oishi, & Roth, 2014) was the affective outcome participants reported most frequently and was also linked with the most prominent actions (i.e., tool exploration, prototyping, and community interactions) found in course activity. Several participants explained that in addition to feeling more creative as individuals, they appreciated creativity in others because they used peer and instructor feedback to improve their own design ideas. In this way, participants’ development of creative agency expanded from individual to collective orientations. A set of practical guidelines for project-based instruction and suggestions for the most productive future research will be also be presented.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Designing creatively: Classroom activities for project-based learning.</h2>
<p><em>CHEP, Virginia Tech, 2020</em></p>
	
<p>What classroom activities can be used to support a group of students who are all working on individual projects across multiple domains? This is the question the presenters faced as they designed and led project-based courses to help undergraduate students learn to use technology more innovatively in the workplace. Methods from design thinking provided many of classroom activities, and lessons from the creativity literature helped to inform the way the activities were implemented and modeled by the instructors. This session will provide an overview of the course design and the classroom activities that engaged students and the instructors.</p>
<p>The course was project-based (Blumenfeld et al., 1991; Condliffe, 2017; Edutopia, 2001) and its design was informed by the theoretical perspectives of constructionism, situated cognition/situated learning, and self-directed learning—as described by Clinton and Rieber (2010) and especially with regard to the freedom in choosing any project topic, which was a primary characteristic of the first of three sequential courses in the studio experience. The assignments and in-class activities completed by students were based upon theories and practices borrowed from the creativity and design thinking literature. While students did most their project work outside of class, classroom activities were oriented toward helping students to share ideas and to provide each other with design feedback.</p>
<p>A unifying theme that might be applied to all class activity is community building. Eventually, the course community became characterized by a  “culture of prototyping” (Rauth, Köppen, Jobst, & Meinel, 2010, p. 3), but building the community took time. In this session we will share the classroom activities that helped to build the supportive course community. These activities are (a) tool presentations, (b) idea presentations, and (c) prototype presentations that incorporated peer review and feedback. Attendees will be asked to participate by briefly sharing some favorite tools they use to accomplish their work as a way of modeling the way idea sharing activities were implemented in our course.</p>
<p>Creativity research has produced some basic findings about the nature of creativity, such as its generally accepted definition (Runco & Jaeger, 2012), divergent thinking (Silvia et al., 2008), convergent thinking (Cropley, 2006), problem finding (Getzels, 1975), and psychological safety (Amabile & Pillemer, 2012). The instructors simplified and shared findings from this and similar research as a way of demystifying creativity for students, and to help them understand that creativity is a skill that can be developed as any other. Attendees will be asked to complete a brief survey assessing their beliefs about their creativity and the results will then be displayed and briefly discussed.</p>
<p>Finally, the general course design will be described, and the presenters will provide their assessment of the effectiveness of the course, including ideas for improvement. At this point the attendees will be asked to engage in a design conversation concerning any questions or ideas they may have about implementing a similar kind of learning environment.</p>
